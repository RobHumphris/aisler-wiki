### 1. Start a new project ###
![Start a new Project in AISLER](../assets/start_project.png)

Click **Start New Project** in the top bar of the website. This link is available on any AISLER site.

**Pro Tip:** If you want to be quick, navigate to [https://go.aisler.net/p/new](https://go.aisler.net/p/new). This will create a new project.

### 2. Upload your Eagle board file ###

You will then be redirected to a new Project Page. Click **Select File** and select your ***.brd** File. Once you confirm the file dialog, AISLER will instantly start inspecting your file:

It may take up to 6 seconds to have your project analyzed.

### 3. Proof your design (optional)
![Proof your Eagle design](assets/manufacturing_renderings.png)

AISLER renders manufacturing images so that you can proof your design.

**Not happy with how things are rendered?** Repeat step 1 to 3 until you are. It doesn't cost anything to iterate, and it helps you get your project manufactured with ease.   

### 4. Setup a repository and project name ###
![Setup a repository and name for your Fritzing project](../assets/new_project.png)

Just create or use an existing repository and create a new project. AISLER will try to suggest a name for you, but feel free to change it to match your flavor. This is the final step and you will have a documented project that you can let AISLER manufacture for you.

**Pro tip:** Your projects are organized just like git-repositories, so when you pick a repository and a project name, think of it this way. AISLER brings versioning out-of-the-box. So you won't need to open a new project for each iteration but rather upload a new version on the board's detail page.

### 5. Order your circuit board ###

Ordering your project is now as easy as a snap. Just look on the right, it's on the same page and the only thing you have to do is add your shipping address. Then just click **Pay Now** and you will be redirected to our payment provider **Mollie**.
