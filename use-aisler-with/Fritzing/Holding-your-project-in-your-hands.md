You have waited **12 days** the most and now it is time to unwrap your project. Follow these steps to make the most of your project.

4. Holding your project in your hands

### 1. Assemble your board ###

Soldering is easy and fun (after a short phase of frustration) and there are many very nice tutorials:

- [NASA (yeah!)](http://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/telescope/soldering.htm)
- [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-solder/)
- [YouTube (CuriousInventor)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_NU2ruzyc4&feature=related)

Don't have any soldering tools yet? Don't worry, ask the AISLER guys for advice.

### 2. Profit

Now that you have assembled your board and it is (hopefully) working, why don't you:

- take a picture and publish it on AISLER.net for others to also be able to build it?
- Upload it to Fritzing.orgâ€˜s Project Archive.
- write an [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/).
- send an Email to the [Make Magazine](http://makezine.com/).
- amaze your friends.
- fool your enemies.
- go into business selling widgets (you an use AISLER for that, too).
- change the world!
- or change your living room.

We hope this helped you. If you have further questions, feel free to point it to [felix@aisler.net](mailto:felix@aisler.net).
