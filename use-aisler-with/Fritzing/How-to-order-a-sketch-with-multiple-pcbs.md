# How to order a Sketch with multiple PCBs
Projects on AISLER are organized in repositories which contain one or more projects. As only on project at a time can be ordered we've to split up Fritzing Sketches with multiple PCBs.

## 1. Open the original Sketch

## 2. Select a single PCB to export
Netx step is to select the PCB you would like to export. Using your mouse select the whole PCB and hit Control-C (Strg-C) to copy.

## 3. Create new Sketch
Now create a new Sketch to paste the previously copied PCB to. Before you paste the PCB you've to remove the default PCB first.

Now paste the PCB using Control-V (Strg-V) and save the Sktech.
Repeate this step for every single PCB.

## 4. Ready to go!
You can now upload all previously created Sketches to AISLER.

Pro Tip: Name the repository after your original Sketch and give the single PCBs distinctive names to recognize them later.
