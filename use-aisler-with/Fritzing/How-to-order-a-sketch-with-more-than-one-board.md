# How to order a Sketch with more than one board
Projects on AISLER are organized in repositories which contain one or more projects. As only on project at a time can be ordered we've to split up Fritzing Sketches with multiple boards.

## 1. Open the original Sketch
Open the original Sketch and save it with a new name.

## 2. Select a single board to export
Next step is to select the board you **do not** like to export. Using your mouse select the whole board and hit âŒ˜-Backspace on Mac or Delete on Windows/Linux to copy.

## 4. Redo the process
Repeate this step for every single board.

## 5. Ready to go!
You can now upload all previously created Sketches to AISLER.

**Pro Tip:** Name the repository after your original Sketch and give the single PCBs distinctive names to recognize them later.
