## 3. Create new Sketch
Now create a new Sketch to paste the previously copied PCB to. Before you paste the board you've to remove the default board first.

Now paste the board using Control-V (Strg-V) and save the Sktech.
Repeate this step for every single board.

## 4. Ready to go!
You can now upload all previously created Sketches to AISLER.

Pro Tip: Name the repository after your original Sketch and give the single PCBs distinctive names to recognize them later.
