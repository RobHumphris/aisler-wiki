# How do you calculate the price for PCBs?
We calculate the price for the PCBs solely by the PCB dimensions. Everything else such as drills is included.
Depending on the dimensions the following €/cm2 price applies.

| Dimension       | Price per cm2 |
| below 5 cm2     | € 0.40        |
| 7.5 cm2         | € 0.35        |
| 10.0 cm2        | € 0.30        |
| 12.5 cm2        | € 0.29        |
| 15.0 cm2        | € 0.28        |
| 20.0 cm2        | € 0.27        |
| 25.0 cm2        | € 0.26        |
| 30.0 cm2        | € 0.25        |
| 35.0 cm2        | € 0.24        |
| 40.0 cm2        | € 0.23        |
| 50.0 cm2        | € 0.22        |
| 60.0 cm2        | € 0.21        |
| 70.0 cm2        | € 0.20        |
| 100.0 cm2       | € 0.19        |
| 120.0 cm2       | € 0.18        |
| above 140.0 cm2 | € 0.16        |

Please note that the minimum order quantity is three.

## Example
If the PCB size is 30mm by 30mm the following price would apply:
30 * 30 = 900mm2 = 9cm2
9cm2 * €0.30 = €2.70
€2.70 * 3 = €8.10
Total: €8.10 for three PCBs

For orders above € 30.0 shipping worldwide is free.
