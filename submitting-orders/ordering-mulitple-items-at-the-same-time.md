# How do I order more than one item at the same time?
AISLER has an intelligent shopping basket, that automatically bundles orders where possible. Once you have made one order, AISLER automatically detects if you are still on the same production batch and then removes additional shipping costs. That way, you can save shipping. 

You will still have to go through the **Pay now** process multiple times, however our trusted payment provider will already know which payment you selected the last time, so this process should be a lot faster. When the order has been manufactured we will then consolidate the orders into one shipment.
